# PCB_Motor-drive-plate-for-laboratory-trolley
The motor drive board of the material transport trolley equipment in the school laboratory is broken. Please copy the board as required by the teacher. It took 4 days to make the AD, but it was not done well. The board made when uploading this project has been shipped. There is also a board, which will be uploaded later.
